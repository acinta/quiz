<h2>Section 2 - General</h2>
<h3>Q2</h3>
<h4>What do you find most exciting or interesting about working in the software development field?</h4>
I love that the whole software development field is a process of creation.  Because I am an artist and craftsperson (fiber arts), I've always loved witnessing my creations and marveling.  It's so powerful and fun and ultimately rewarding when things work out how you want.

<h3>Q3</h3>
<h4>In your career to date, what are you most proud of and why?</h4>
Globally, I'm proud of being a front-end developer having come out of art school and being largely self-taught (credits to Art Institute for web-design and development and IEEE for javascript classes).  More local and immediate is that I have had a leading role in Bank of America's new virtual assistant, Erica.  I was solely responsible for creating the HTML/CSS prototypes from which our usability tests and presentation layers have first seen daylight and evolved to where she is now used by over 1,000,000 user worldwide.
